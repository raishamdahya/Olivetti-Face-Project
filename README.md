# Olivetti-Face-Project
The purpose of this project is to develop a face recognition model using the Olivetti faces dataset. Whilst that is the main purpose of the project, it is also to help me learn more about machine learning using algorithms like:

K-Neighbours Classifier
Making a PCA Transformer
Support Vector Classifier
